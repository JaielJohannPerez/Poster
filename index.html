            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>The study concludes that the floor vacuuming robot is structured around various components such as structural, mechanical, control, sensing, and power supply. Its design focuses on integrating these components efficiently, with specifications like integrating an expansion board to the Arduino UNO R3. Operationally, it uses Pulse Width Modulation for speed regulation, IR and ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection, and a high-speed fan for suction, activated by a battery connection switch. In terms of performance, the robot detects objects up to 200 cm away, completes tasks in 10 minutes on a 25 sqm surface, and consumes approximately 1800 mA, allowing for around 2 hours and 30 minutes of operation on two LiPo batteries with a capacity of 4600 mAH.</p>
